<p>Russian soldiers in a former Armenian village, 1915</p>
<p>The <a href=""> Armenian genocide</a> was the systematic destruction of the<a href=""> Armenian people and identity in the 
    Ottoman Empire</a> during World War I. At the orders of Talaat Pasha, an estimated 800,000 to 
    1,200,000 Armenian women, children, and elderly or infirm people were sent on death marches to 
    the Syrian Desert in 1915 and 1916. Driven forward by paramilitary escorts, the deportees were 
    deprived of food and water and subjected to robberies, rapes, and massacres. In the desert, the 
    survivors were dispersed into concentration camps. In 1916 another wave of massacres was 
    ordered, leaving about 200,000 deportees alive by the end of 1916. Around 100,000 to 200,000 
    Armenian women and children were forcibly converted to Islam and integrated into Muslim 
    households. The Turkish nationalist movement carried out massacres and ethnic cleansing of 
    survivors during the Turkish War of Independence after World War I. The Armenian genocide 
    destroyed more than two millennia of Armenian civilization in eastern Anatolia).
